While developing this batch job, faced below issues-
Issue 1:
org.springframework.jdbc.BadSqlGrammarException: PreparedStatementCallback; bad SQL grammar [SELECT JOB_INSTANCE_ID, JOB_NAME from BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE where JOB_NAME = ? order by JOB_INSTANCE_ID desc]; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
Solution:
Add oracle specific sql files that save metadata for its recover/retry functionality.

Issue 2:
org.springframework.batch.item.file.transform.IncorrectTokenCountException: Incorrect number of tokens found in record: expected 6 actual 1
Solution:
Add delimiter to resolve semi-colon as below-
<property name="delimiter" value=";" />

Issue 3:
java.sql.BatchUpdateException: ORA-01861: literal does not match format string
Defined fields in model class as per datatype of record_dump_tbl table fields. E.g. for number, defined field as Integer, for Date, defined field as java.util.Date.

Issue 4:
Failed to convert property value of type java.lang.String to required type java.util.Date. java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot convert value of type 'java.lang.string' to required type 'java.util.date'
Solution:
Add custom editor to convert String into Date. All csv file data is read as String. So we need to convert date, int, double related field from String to corresponding object.
